            <b>Nakamura<br></b> was born in Fukuoka, a city in Fukuoka Prefecture on the northern shore of the Japanese island Kyushu. He spent his early childhood in Wakamatsu (in today's Kitakyushu), where both of his parents were born and raised.

          <h1 class="h1">Career</h1><br><br>
          <img src="./images/img1.jpg" class="img">
          <p  class="All-text">Nakamura's first experience in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region was in 1978, when he served as a medic for a Fukuoka Climbing Association mountaineering team during an expedition to climb Tirich Mir in western Pakistan. He was drawn there to pursue his love of mountain climbing and his hobby of collecting insects. At the request of Pakistan's Ministry of Tourism, Nakamura provided medical care to residents near the remote mountaineering base, which was located in the vicinity of Peshawar, Pakistan. Nakamura treated many patients suffering from tuberculosis and leprosy, which he attributed to malnutrition and poverty in the area.
            With this experience in mind, he returned to Peshawar in 1984 as a volunteer with the Japan Overseas Christian Medical Cooperative Service at the Mission Hospital in Peshawar. He again treated patients with leprosy as well as Afghan refugees who were fleeing the Soviet–Afghan War.[17][18] His wife and young children accompanied him and his children attended an American-funded international school.[9] He initially intended to stay in Peshawar for five to six years.[19]

            Although the clinic was focused on leprosy, Nakamura saw that leprosy-prone areas had high incidence of other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. In order to provide treatment for patients suffering from other diseases, he began to offer his own medical services independent of the Mission Hospital. In the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization began providing multi drug therapy (MDT) treatment free of cost to leprosy patients in a program originally funded by the Nippon Foundation. While international attention and aid to fight leprosy grew, Nakamura observed the number of Afghan patients with other infectious diseases continuing to increase without similar assistance, prompting him to establish a new hospital and expand his efforts.

            Nakamura was fatally shot in a targeted killing on 4 December 2019 in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. The attackers also killed five others, including his bodyguards and driver. Police said that Nakamura, while sitting in the front passenger seat, was shot with five bullets at close range from above. According to a doctor performing the autopsy, the bullet entered Nakamura's right chest and lodged near the pelvis.

              Of the seven to eight assailants, three were armed with fully automatic rifles and other firearms. The assailants were wearing traditional Afghan dress but did not cover their faces. According to an eyewitness: "The armed men drove to a restaurant near the site of the attack in two separate cars. When the vehicle carrying Nakamura approached, the attackers ran up and shot at it from both sides, killing Nakamura's bodyguard first." As one of the gunmen yelled at the witness to stay away from the scene, the witness hid at the restaurant. "When the sound of gunshots subsided, I heard voices trying to determine whether Nakamura and the others were all dead, before a few more shots were fired. 'It's finished, let's go', I heard one of the men say before they fled in their cars", the witness added.

              Nakamura remained conscious after the attack and received treatment at a local hospital in Jalalabad, but bled to death at Jalalabad Airport as he was being prepared to be airlifted to a hospital at Bagram Airfield, a U.S. military base located 50 kilometres (30 mi) north of Kabul.

              The security camera footage did not capture the actual shooting, but did show the two vehicles used by the assailants. Afghan security officials arrested two men in connection with the license plates of the vehicles identified in the footage.

          On 7 December, a state funeral ceremony was held for Nakamura at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport, during which the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani joined soldiers to carry the coffin wrapped in the Afghan flag towards an airplane. Nakamura's wife, Naoko, and eldest daughter, Akiko, were present at the ceremony in Kabul. President Ghani said: "[Nakamura's] killers will definitely go to hell. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces will find out the perpetrators and will hand them over to justice".

          On 8 December, the airplane carrying Nakamura's body reached Tokyo's Narita International Airport. Nakamura's wife and eldest daughter, as well as the Japanese Senior Vice Foreign Minister Keisuke Suzuki, laid flowers and observed a moment of silence as the body was unloaded from the airplane in Tokyo.

          On 11 December, a funeral was held for Nakamura in his hometown Fukuoka, attended by 1,300 mourners. The Afghan flag was laid over the coffin of Nakamura. Portraits of the other five Afghans killed with him were also displayed.

          The Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, offered his "deepest condolences" to
           the families of Nakamura and others who were killed in the attack, and called
            Nakamura's death a big loss to the people of Afghanistan.[44] Ashraf Ghani's
             spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said: "Dr Nakamura dedicated all his life to change
              the lives of Afghans, working on water management, dams and improving traditional
               agriculture." The governor of Nangarhar province, Shah Mahmood Miakhel, said: 
               "All the people of Nangarhar were saddened by Dr Nakamura's death and were thankful
                for the many years he spent helping the people.
